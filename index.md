Only 4 more weeks until graduation!

## New Branch

Hi Todd, I'm adding this just so you can see what it's like to have someone work on your site, write it on a new branch in their fork, and ultimately, so you can receive a pull request, which you can then accept or reject. Pretty cool, huh?

Don't worry, I won't be offended when you reject my pull request. ;)

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/toddschaffer/dice-homework/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
